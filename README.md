# Covid19_Dashboard

In this project let's build a Covid19 Dashboard by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using component lifecycle methods, routing concepts and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own.
